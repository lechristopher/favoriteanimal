	<h1>King of the Jungle</h1>

		<p>The lion is known as the king of the jungle. For most of the day it sleeps and may appear lazy to the naked eye, but one does not want to provoke a lion, for it is the most ferocious beast in all of the kingdom. A lion does not waste it's time meddling with futile things. When it wakes, it hunts and you better run if you ever meet one.</p>
